Hey Peeps! amp#x200B; So I've been getting these random freezes on my PC not sure what it is. Tried a bunch of things i saw online but no luck. I have: Ran SFC Mem Diag Reseated Ram Reseated GPU Reinstalled OS twice on two different ssd's (One new One Old) Ran all Windows Updates Updated all drivers Cleaned out all the dust in my case This has been happening for quite a while now it isnt recent amp#x200B; But SOMEHOW im still getting these random freezes C Language Tips and Tricks Dealing with Pointers Pointers are interpreted differently on the C28x and the CLA. The C28x treats them as 32-bit data types (address bus size being 22-bits wide can only fit into a 32-bit data type) while the CLA only has an address mems diag free download - MEMS, Memory Diag, Disk Diag, and many more programs. 
I have a memory problem. i did 3 runs of 2 passes each with windows mem diag. i have 2 sticks of 8gb ram and 4 dimm slots. i use slots 1 and 3. Ram will be labeled as a and b. Ram a in slot 1 passes Windows mem diag. ram b in slot 1 passes. ram a in slot 3 passes. ram b in slot 3 fails twice, passes the last time.

This feature is not available right now. Please try again later. EDIT 2: Hey guys. So I did a series of trial-and-error by removing/installing combinations of ram sticks and running MemDiagTool. Let's name my RAM sticks #1 and #2. I found that everytime #2 was installed in slot B2, I would get the notification for a hardware malfunction, but weirdly enough, #1 in B2 works fine and #2 in A2 works fine as well. So for now, I installed #2 in A2 and #1 in B2, as it passed the test. After about 18 hours of use, I haven't run into any of the ongoing issues. I don't. Data fusion is an important issue for object tracking in autonomous systems such as robotics and surveillance. In this paper, we present a multiple-object tracking system whose design is based on multiple Kalman filters dealing with observations from two different kinds of physical sensors.

So I am at a loss with my computer crashing that I have been troubleshooting since yesterday. It will lock up where the everything on the screen will freeze, it will sometimes play a short blip of static through the speakers and it won't respond at all. It does this when booted of a USB or any of my three Operating Systems which are on different HDDs. I ran some memory diags all last night and it didn't find any problems \(doesn't mean they don't exist\) the CPU isn't overheating

Hello, i should preface this by saying i have read most of the posts on this issue both on here and throughout google and i have tried everything suggested and i still havent found a fix, so i decided to ask you guys directly.

No issues outside of the long beep that happens while gaming in BF4. Its only one beep but its a long beep. It happens consistently throughout the gaming session and is extremely annoying. I've looked for beep codes and none are just 1 long beep, especially when the PC is running. I ran Windows Mem Diag and it was clean. Any ideas?

Evening /r/techsupportgore Never thought I'd see myself coming here (i'm a system administrator), but I'm having a problem with my current PC I can't seem to track down. I'm running on a fresh install of Windows 10 Enterprise, and continue to have BSODs under light load. No overclocking or anything along those lines. Everything in Bios is set to stock. The three I've had just tonight: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA I'm thinking it's memory. MEMS_Diag is an application designed to communicate with pre-OBD Rover engine management systems (ECU). Modular Engine Management System (MEMS) This used to show 8GB but I don't know what happened. Speccy only shows 1 slot has RAM in it. I've noticed some crashes lately, randomly checked Speccy and it said 4GB RAM. Tried Googling but all the results were cases where the BIOS and Windows agreed with each other, so I don't know what that means for me. PC build is at the bottom of the post.

As promised in a comment from one of my previous tales, I will begin posting more troubleshooting related stories as opposed to outrageous user stories. This takes place after I made the transition from department supervisor at $TSC to part time and began working for a local governmental agency, $LGA.

I was responsible for all end user computers including OS and applications, printers, networking eqpuipment Download MEMS_Diag apk 4.5 and history version for Android developed by pwoz - Rover MEMS 1.3 / 1.6 /1.9 ECU diagnostics software. As an early Christmas gift to myself, I decided to upgrade my GPU from a GTX 770 to a GTX 1080. Along with this I went ahead and replaced my PSU as a preventative measure (had no previous issues, it was just getting old). Since upgrading, I've been running into some memory issues. The initial problem I was running into is that windows would continuously give me the "Close programs to prevent information loss" Popup. I've had this before on seldom occasions (like once or twice a year)

For the past week I've been struggling to find a solution; most online that have this issue seem to be running surface books. Basically, I am having huge performance issues due to this system process. Started after reseating graphics card in different slot, and then patching WoW, Overwatch routinely. Note I was running fine after reseating card until software changes. Could not even play WoW as I was getting sub 1 fps at mid high (7) settings and ~20 fps on lowest. BF4 opened I know there is an app called Mems diag but I like to be able to connect a laptop to my car, not my mobile phone! So I could do with some directions how to make a cable (as the 1.9 only has one wire connected to the 7 pin of the obd2 plug it talks via what's called the k-line. We moved our users to laptops a few years back and guess what? A few times a week we have users asking to borrow a laptop because they forgot theirs at home. Because of this we have a small fleet of our older, slower, laptops as loaners. Eventually the speed was complained about enough times and now we run manual maintenance every month on them which is a waste of our time.

Hey, r/buildapc, this may not be the right subreddit, but you guys are extremely helpful with troubleshooting so I figured it wouldn't help to ask. I have had built my PC around 2 years ago, and it has been running fairly fine; only issue I've had was a motherboard dying on me. Now though, my pc has began experiencing random freezing and lockups, with me having to hard reset it every time. As the title suggests, it seems very random. It will happen as soon as I start up, in the middle Download MEMS_Diag APK Latest Version 4.5 for Android - Rover MEMS 1.3 / 1.6 /1.9 ECU diagnostics software. 
As the title suggests my Windows 10 machine has started crashing suddenly and restarting it doesn't seem to work. I have gotten a few error messages when the BSOD comes; most of them have to do with memory exceptions, e.g. page_fault_in_non_paged_area, memory_management, etc. I am able to get to the log in screen fine, and I am able to log in. However, when I log in normally it tries to start my apps (spotify, google hangouts, steam, GoG, and maybe a few others), but it always crashes after.

I'll give you the story followed by the symptoms then what I've done (specs at the bottom). I have windows 8.1 and decided to upgrade to 10 via internet because I was having some driver conflicts and some recent virus problems. I made the switch but noticed that I was having some "glitch" problems while running games. It would happen every min or so and is best described as not running smooth. I ended up restoring.

Hello all and thanks for your time. ampnbsp; First I'm running a sabertooth z77 board with an i7-3770k cpu. The pc is about 2.5 years old and has been running like a champ up until a few minutes ago. (Windows 7) First, about 5-10 mins after boot, it just turned off. No BSoD, no anything. I turned it back on and pulled up the temps for the system and windows mem diagnostic. All the temps seemed to be ok, and as I started to run the mem diag, the system shut off again. This time it wouldn't. On Blogger since January 2015. Profile views - 2294. My blogs.
